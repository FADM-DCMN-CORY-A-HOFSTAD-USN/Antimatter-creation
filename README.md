# Antimatter-creation
Every molecule has a specific resonancy that it resonates at. Each proton, neutron, electron, and positron bond enthalpy has a specific resonance that will break and form the bond. Breaking a molecule into atoms with these specific frequencies is possible. Using the inverse bond enthalpy frequency will create the antimatter.
