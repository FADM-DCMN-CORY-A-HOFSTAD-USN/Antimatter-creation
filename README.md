# Antimatter-creation
Every molecule has a specific resonancy that it resonates at. Each proton, neutron, electron, and positron bond enthalpy has a specific resonance that will break and form the bond. Breaking a molecule into atoms with these specific frequencies is possible. Using the inverse bond enthalpy frequency will create the antimatter.

Scientists spend $62 Trillion per gram to smash atoms hoping to punch a CIS atom by chance. This method is similar to taking a trash can lid and hammering it until it is inverted inside out. Sound is affordable. Frequency is the key to all matter.
